### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [django]() - Powerful web framework!
* [Jquery]() - Popular javascript framework
* [bootstrap-4]() - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps

And of course StackLibrary itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

StackLibrary requires [django]() v1.10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd StackLibrary
$ pip install -r requiremnets.txt
```
